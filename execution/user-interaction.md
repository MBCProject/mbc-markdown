User Execution
==============
Malware may include code that relies on specific actions by a user to execute. Note that this MBC behavior differs from [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) in that it does do not include direct code execution (user action for *initial* execution) - MBC does not encompass ATT&CK's Initial Access Tactic.  

**See ATT&CK Technique:** [**User Execution**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204).
