Execution Dependency
====================
Software may require certain run-time or library dependencies consistent with normal software development and deployment. For example, software may require the presence of a .NET or Java runtime or to be run by a webserver that supports PHP. Unlike in [Conditional Execution](../execution/conditional-execute.md) this dependency is not because of an explicit check coded into the malware by the author.
