Capture Evasion
===============
Malware has characteristics enabling it to evade capture from the infected system.

Methods
-------
* **Memory-only Payload**: Malware is never written to disk (e.g., RAT plugins received from the controller are never written to disk).
* **Encrypted Payloads**: Decryption key is stored external to the executable or never touches the disk.
* **Multiple Stages of Loaders**: Multiple stages of loaders are used with an encoded payload.
