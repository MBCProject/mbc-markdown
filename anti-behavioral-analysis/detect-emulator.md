Emulator Detection
==================
Detects whether the malware instance is being executed inside an emulator. If so, conditional execution selects a benign execution path.

Methods
-------
|Name|ID|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Check Emulator-related Registry Keys**|B0004.003|Emulators register artifacts in the registry, which can be detected by malware. For example, installation of QEMU results in the registry key: *HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port 0\Scsi Bus 0\Target Id 0\Logical Unit Id 0* with value=*Identifier* and data=*QEMU*, or registry key: *HARDWARE\Description\System* with value=*SystemBiosVersion* and data=*QEMU*. [[1]](#1)|
|**Check for Emulator-related Files**|B0004.001|Checks whether particular files (e.g., QEMU files) exist.|
|**Check for WINE Version**|B0004.002|Checks for WINE via the `get_wine_version` function from WINE's `ntdll.dll`.|
|**Failed Network Connections**|B0004.004|Some emulated systems fail to handle some network communications; such failures will indicate the emulated environment.|
