# <a name="mbc"></a>Malware Behavior Catalog v3.0 #
The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a catalog of malware objectives and behaviors, created to support malware analysis-oriented use cases, such as labeling, similarity analysis, and standardized reporting. Please see the [FAQ](./yfaq/README.md) page for answers to common questions, and read the [newsletters](./ynewsletters/README.md) for information on the most recent MBC updates and activity.

Open-source malware analysis tools map their output to MBC and ATT&CK:

* [capa](https://github.com/fireeye/capa-rules) - see the [capa rule mapping distribution](./capa.md)
* [CAPE](https://github.com/kevoreilly/community/tree/master/modules/signatures) - see the [CAPE signature mapping distribution](./cape.md)

MBC supports other community efforts:

* [CACAO](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) - a [playbook](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cacao/tree/master/Examples/CACAO-2.0) for the MBC corpus malware [Locky Bart](./xample-malware/locky-bart.md) shows how CACAO can reference MBC behaviors.
* [Attack Flow](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow/tree/main/corpus) - flow diagrams for the MBC corpus malware [Shamoon](./xample-malware/shamoon.md) and [SearchAwesome](./xample-malware/searchawesome.md) illustrate how Attack Flow can reference MBC behaviors.

### Objectives ###
As shown below, malware objectives are based on [ATT&CK tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/), and are tailored for the malware analysis use case of characterizing malware based on known objectives and behaviors. Two malware analysis-specific objectives not in ATT&CK are also defined (ANTI-BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS and ANTI-STATIC ANALYSIS). 

### Behaviors ###
Under each objective, MBC captures all behaviors and code characteristics discovered during malware analysis, with links to [ATT&CK techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) as appropriate. Names of MBC behaviors may or may not match related ATT&CK techniques. Any content provided on behavior pages is *supplemental* to ATT&CK content. In other words, ATT&CK content is not duplicated in MBC, and MBC users will reference ATT&CK while capturing malware behaviors.

### Methods ###
Methods are associated with behaviors and serve different roles, depending on the behavior. In some cases, a method further refines a behavior (i.e., sub-behavior); in other cases, a method is an implementation of a behavior. Previously, methods had no ATT&CK counterpart, but beginning in April 2020, ATT&CK defines sub-techniques, which are similar to methods.

Note that a method cannot be used without a behavior.

### Micro-objectives / Micro-behaviors ###
Some malware behaviors are low-level, support many objectives and other behaviors, and aren't necessarily malicious. For example, a TCP socket may be created, or a string may be checked for some condition. Because such behaviors are often noted in malware analysis, they are captured in MBC. See [Micro-behaviors](./micro-behaviors/README.md) for details.

### <a name="ids"></a>Identifiers ###
As shown below, the letter of an identifier relays information about a behavior. Note that letters used in MBC v2 and v3 are changed from MBC v1.

|**Letter**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**B**|*B0040*|An MBC behavior.|
|**C**|*C0015*|An MBC micro-behavior.|
|**T**|*T1234*|An ATT&CK technique.|
|**E**|*E1234*|An ATT&CK technique that has been enhanced with malware-specific details. The numerical portion of the identifier will match the ATT&CK ID (e.g., E1234 enhances T1234).|
|**F**|*F0004*|An ATT&CK sub-technique that has been enhanced with malware-specific details.|

Two letters of an identifier relay information about an objective.

|**Letter**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**OB**|*OB0001*|An MBC objective.|
|**OC**|*OC0003*|An MBC micro-objective.|

Identifiers of methods are formatted in the same way as ATT&CK sub-techniques. If MBC defines a new method for an existing ATT&CK technique, the identifier is changed from "T" to "E" and an "m" identifier is added (e.g., a method added to T1234 would be denoted *E1234.m01* and is different than *T1234.001*, although both refer to the T1234 ATT&CK technique). Method identifiers of "B", "C", and "F" behaviors are defined without the "m" (e.g., *B0008.009*; *C0005.002*; *F0001.005*).

When two or more MBC behaviors refine the same ATT&CK technique, each is given an MBC identifier and each references the ATT&CK identifier. When a new ATT&CK technique is defined *after* an MBC behavior has been defined, the preexisting MBC identifier is preserved and the new ATT&CK identifier is referenced.

In cases where an MBC behavior enhances a technique/sub-technique that is defined in both ATT&CK Mobile and Enterprise, the "E" identifier used in MBC corresponds to the Enterprise identifier. For example, the Obfuscated Files or Information technique has identifier <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/">T1027</a> in Enterprise, identifier <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/">T1406</a> in Mobile, and identifier <a href="./defense-evasion/obfuscated-files-or-information.md">E1027</a> in MBC.

### Canonical Representation ###
The canonical representation for MBC content is **OBJECTIVE::Behavior::Method**. For example, *ANTI-BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS::Debugger Detection::Process Environment Block*. 

Objectives and behaviors can be used alone, but a method *must* be associated with a behavior.

### STIX 2.1 Representation ###
A STIX 2.1 representation for MBC v3.0 is available in the [mbc-stix2.1](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2.1) repository. It's based on a refined STIX 2.1 [Malware Behavior Extension](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/tree/main/extension-definition-specifications/malware-behavior) that includes new STIX domain objects for MBC objectives, behaviors, and methods.

### Navigator View ###
This visual representation of the MBC Matrix is based on the ATT&CK Navigator. Two views are available: 

* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/master/yfaq/mbc_matrix_with_ids.svg" target="_blank">Matrix with identifiers</a>
* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/master/yfaq/mbc_matrix_without_ids.svg" target="_blank">Matrix without identifiers</a>

### Malware Corpus ###
The MBC contains a [malware corpus](./xample-malware/README.md) where each malware entry is decomposed into behaviors that are mapped to ATT&CK and MBC. The mappings are based on open source malware analysis reports. Note that some malware types are also present in the ATT&CK software page. We refer readers to the corresponding ATT&CK page for a list of identified ATT&CK techniques. However, we will list any newly identified ATT&CK techniques in the MBC malware page.
