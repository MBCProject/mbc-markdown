Executable Code Virtualization
==============================
Original executable code is virtualized by translating the code into a special format that only a special virtual machine (VM) can run; the VM uses a customized virtual instruction set. A "stub" function calls the VM when the code is run. Virtualized code makes static analysis and reverse engineering more difficult; dumped code wonâ€™t run without the VM.

Virtualized code is a software protection technique. Themida is a commercial tool; VMProtect is an open source tool. [[1]](#1) 

Methods

|Name|ID|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Multiple VMs**|B0008.001|Multiple virtual machines with different architectures (CISC, RISC, etc.) can be used inside of a single executable in order to make reverse engineering even more difficult.|
