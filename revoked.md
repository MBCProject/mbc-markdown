# Revoked Behaviors and Methods
The Malware Behavior Catalog has revoked a small number of behaviors and methods as it has evolved.  The IDs for revoked behaviors and methods are not re-used.  If it appears that we are missing behavior or methods IDs, this page will explain what revoked IDs previously represented, when they were retired, and the reason for retiring them.

| Revoked ID | Behavior or Method | Revocation Date | Reason |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| C0013 | UDP Communication | 25 September 2020 | Merged into C0001 because UDP also communicates over socket interfaces |
| B0001.007 | Interrupt 1 | 2 August 2022 | Merged into B0001.006 to create a more general 'Interruption' method |
| B0012.004 | Variable Recomposition | 21 November 2022 | Moved to B0032.021 |
