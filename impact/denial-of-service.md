Denial of Service
=================
Malware may make a network unavailable, for example, by launching a network-based denial of service (DoS) attack. 

Endpoint denial of service behaviors are captured by the [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/) technique.

The subsequently defined ATT&CK technique [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/) is related to this MBC behavior.
