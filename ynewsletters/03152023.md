# <a name="faq"></a>Malware Behavior Catalog Newsletter # 
**March 15, 2023**

Hello all!

Here are the highlights of MBC development since the December newsletter:

* Drafted a STIX 2.1 extension for malware behaviors
* Added Detection content to behavior pages based on capa rules and CAPE signatures
* Integrated capa analysis results into MBC's [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md)
* Submitted a PR to [capa]() with suggested additions
* Submitted a PR to [CAPE](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2) with suggested signature mappings additions and updates
* Populated the new behavior properties (version, created and last modified dates)
* Identified relationships between MBC methods and [Unprotect Project](https://www.unprotect.it/) techniques and added Unprotect technique identifiers to method descriptions (the Unprotect Project now includes MBC method identifiers).

In May, we plan to release MBC v3.0, along with an updated STIX 2.1 representation. We're also working on a MBC website!
