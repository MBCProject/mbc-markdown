Hello all!

Here are highlights of recent MBC developments:

* Added detection information to behavior pages (based on capa rules and CAPE signatures)
* Integrated capa analysis results into MBC's [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md)
* Drafted a STIX 2.1 extension to better capture MBC content in STIX
* Identified relationships between MBC methods and [Unprotect Project](https://www.unprotect.it/) techniques
* Added Unprotect IDs to method descriptions (the Unprotect Project references MBC method IDs)
* Reviewed and updated MBC content to make language more consistent; fixed broken links
* Populated new behavior properties (version, created and last modified dates)
* Submitted a [PR to capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/pull/674) with suggested additions
* Submitted a [PR to CAPE](https://github.com/CAPESandbox/community/pull/344) with suggested additions and updates

In May, we plan to release MBC v3.0, along with an updated STIX 2.1 representation. We're also working on an MBC website!
