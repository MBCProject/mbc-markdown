# <a name="faq"></a>Malware Behavior Catalog Newsletter # 
**March 15, 2023**

Hello all!

Here are highlights of MBC development since the last newsletter:

* Drafted a STIX 2.1 extension to better capture MBC content in STIX
* Added Detection content to behavior pages based on capa rules and CAPE signatures
* Identified relationships between MBC methods and [Unprotect Project](https://www.unprotect.it/) techniques; added Unprotect IDs to method descriptions (the Unprotect Project now includes MBC method IDs).
* Integrated capa analysis results into MBC's [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md)
* Submitted a [PR to capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/pull/674) with suggested additions
* Submitted a [PR to CAPE](https://github.com/CAPESandbox/community/pull/344) with suggested additions and updates
* Reviewed content to make language more consistent; fixed broken links
* Populated new behavior properties (version, created and last modified dates)

In May, we plan to release MBC v3.0, along with an updated STIX 2.1 representation. We're also working on a MBC website!
