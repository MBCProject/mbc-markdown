Hello all!

Highlights of recent MBC development include:

* Released MBC v2.3, which aligns MBC with ATT&CK v11 (plus enhanced descriptions and formatting updates)
* Released v22.09 of the STIX 2 representation for MBC v2.3 ([mbc-stix2](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2))
* Updated [capa](https://github.com/fireeye/capa) rules to map to MBC v2.3
* Expanded the [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md) of mapped malware examples
* Began meeting with MBC users to understand their use cases

Next, we'll be considering questions such as whether the MBC's terminology should more closely match ATT&CK's. For example, should MBC "behaviors" instead be referred to as "techniques"? We'll also be adding to the malware corpus, as well as adding code snippets to MBC behavior pages. Please email us at mbc@mitre.org to let us know what you think. 

**Please let us know if you're interested in meeting with our team. We'd love to get your feedback and understand your MBC use cases!**
