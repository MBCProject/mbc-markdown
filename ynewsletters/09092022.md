Hello all!

Highlights of recent MBC development include:

* Released MBC v2.3, which aligns MBC with ATT&CK v11
* Released v22.09 of the STIX 2 representation for MBC v2.3 ([mbc-stix2](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2))
* Updated [capa](https://github.com/fireeye/capa) rules to map to MBC v2.3
* Expanded the [malware corpus](./xample-malware/README.md) of mapped malware examples
* Began meeting with MBC users to understand their use cases

Please let us know if you're interested in meeting with our team. We'd love to get your feedback and understand your MBC use cases!

Next, we'll be considering whether the MBC's terminology should more closely match ATT&CK's. For example, should MBC "behaviors" instead be referred to as "techniques"? Please email us at mbc@mitre.org to let us know what you think.
