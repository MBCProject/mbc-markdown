**September 9, 2022**

Hello all!

Highlights of recent MBC development include:

* Released **MBC v2.3**, which aligns MBC with ATT&CK v11 (plus other updates*)
* Released [v22.09](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2/tree/v22.09) of the STIX 2 representation for MBC v2.3
* Updated [capa](https://github.com/fireeye/capa) rules to map to MBC v2.3
* Expanded MBC's [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md) of mapped malware examples
* Began meeting with MBC users to understand their use cases

Next, we'll be considering questions, such as whether the MBC's terminology should more closely match ATT&CK's. For example, should MBC "behaviors" instead be referred to as "techniques"? We'll also be expanding the malware corpus, as well as adding [code snippets](../anti-behavioral-analysis/sandbox-detection.md/#snippet) to MBC behavior pages. Please email us at mbc@mitre.org to let us know what you think. 

**Please let us know if you're interested in meeting with our team. We'd love to get your feedback and understand your MBC use cases!**

Other updates include:
* Behavior/method descriptions enhanced
* HTML tables fixed inside markdown
* Histograms added for capa mappings
* Malware corpus documentation expanded
* READMEs updated
* Markdown file names updated to match behavior names
* ATT&CK technique identifiers added to links
* MBC behavior table added
* Behavior page content (order and wording) updated for consistency
