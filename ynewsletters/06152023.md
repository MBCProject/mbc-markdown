**June 15, 2023**

Hello everyone!

Highlights of recent MBC developments include:

* Refined the [STIX 2.1 Malware Behavior Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1azr8ewNXhWyLt1a2wE2cG964QuFSPdIBSqCJFJrwEVo/edit?usp=sharing), which includes STIX domain objects for MBC objectives, behaviors, and methods.
* Added details to behavior descriptions.
* Expanded the corpus with hand-curated samples, focusing on behaviors without representative malware.
* Defined [Attack Flows](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow/tree/main/corpus) for [Shamoon](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/Lauren-malware-corpus/xample-malware/shamoon.md) and [SearchAwesome](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/Lauren-malware-corpus/xample-malware/searchawesome.md), which reference MBC behaviors.
* Defined a [CACAO](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cacao) playbook for Locky Bart, which references MBC behaviors (will be submitted to the CACAO example repo soon).
* Continued MBC website development, which involves modifying MITRE ATT&CK tools and developing a script to translate MBC markdown content to STIX JSON. The website is slated to go live in the fall.

MBC 3.0 will be released when the updated STIX 2.1 representation is finished and will include the changes outlined in recent newsletters.
