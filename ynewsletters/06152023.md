# <a name="faq"></a>Malware Behavior Catalog Newsletter # 
**June 15, 2023**

Hello everyone!

Highlights of recent MBC developments include:

* Added details to behavior descriptions, replacing single sentences with more complete summaries.
* Refined the [STIX 2.1 Malware Behavior Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1azr8ewNXhWyLt1a2wE2cG964QuFSPdIBSqCJFJrwEVo/edit?usp=sharing), which includes new STIX domain objects for MBC objectives, behaviors, and methods.
* Expanded the corpus with hand-curated samples, focusing on behaviors without representative malware.
* Defined proof-of-concept [Attack Flows](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow/tree/main/corpus) for two corpus samples
* Defined proof-of-concept [CACAO Attack playbook](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cacao) for one corpus sample (will be submitted to the CACAO example repo soon)
* Continued MBC website development, which involves modifying MITRE ATT&CK tools and developing a script to translate MBC markdown content to STIX JSON. The website is slated to go live in the fall.

MBC 3.0 will be released when the updated STIX 2.1 representation is finished and will include the changes outlined in recent newsletters.
