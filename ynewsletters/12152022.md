**December 15, 2022**

Hi everyone!

Highlights of recent MBC development include:

* Finalized MBC terminology (MBC will continue using the terms "behaviors" and "objectives")
* Added new properties to behavior pages (see [Sandbox Detection](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/sandbox-detection.md) for a behavior that includes detection and code snippet information)
* Reviewed ATT&CK v12 (no updates to MBC required)
* Released [v22.12](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2/tree/v22.12) of the STIX 2.1 representation (corrections to v22.10)
* Reviewed [CAPE](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2) signature mappings (it was exciting to discover that CAPE maps its signatures to MBC!)
* Expanded MBC's [malware corpus](../xample-malware/README.md)

Going forward, we'll continue expanding the malware corpus and will integrate capa results to existing corpus entries. We'll also be populating the new behavior properties, focusing on detection content.  

We activated [Discussions](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/discussions) on GitHub, so please any post questions or comments there. You can also email us at mbc@mitre.org to let us know what you think. 

**If you're interested in meeting with our team - please let us know. We'd love to get your feedback and understand your MBC use cases!**
