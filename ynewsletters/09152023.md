Documentation and the JSON schemas are available in the OASIS [STIX Common Objects](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/tree/main/extension-definition-specifications/malware-behavior-8e9) repository.
* Preparing MBC 3.0 (release date 29 September).
* Preparing release of the STIX 2.1 representation for MBC 3.0, which is based on the new malware behavior extension and will be available in a new [mbc-stix2.1](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2.1) repository (release date 29 September).
* Revised the [MBC FAQ](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/main/yfaq), adding new content and updating and reorganizing existing content.
* Updated MBC for ATT&CK v13.1 (full review resulted in one minor change to MBC).
* Created a [page](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/tree/main/yfaq/pafish.md) showing how [Pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish) behaviors map to MBC.
