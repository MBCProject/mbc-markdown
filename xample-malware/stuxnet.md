# Stuxnet

A malicious worm targeting SCADA systems.


## ATT&CK Techniques

|Name|Use|
|---|---|
|[Defense Evasion::Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)|Encode data using XOR (This capa rule had 3 matches) [[2]](#2) |
|[Discovery::System Information Discovery (T1082)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)|Check OS version (This capa rule had 1 match) [[2]](#2) |
|[Execution::Shared Modules (T1129)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)|Parse PE header (This capa rule had 2 matches) [[2]](#2) |

See ATT&CK: [Stuxnet - Techniques Used](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603/).

## Enhanced ATT&CK Techniques

|Name|Use|
|---|---|
|[Defense Evasion::Hijack Execution Flow::Import Address Table Hooking (F0015.003)](../defense-evasion/hijack-execution-flow.md)|Stuxnet hooks ntdll.dll to monitor for requests to load specially crafted file names which are mapped to a location specified by Stuxnet.  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Process Injection::Dynamic-link Library Injection (E1055.001)](../defense-evasion/process-injection.md)|Stuxnet injects the entire DLL into another process and then just calls the particular export  [[1]](#1) |
|[Discovery::System Information Discovery (E1082)](../discovery/system-information-discovery.md)|Gathers information (OS version, workgroup status, computer name, domain/workgroup name, file name of infected project file) about each computer in the net to spread itself  [[1]](#1) |
|[Anti-Static Analysis::Obfuscated Files or Information::Encoding (E1027.m01)](../defense-evasion/obfuscated-files-or-information.md.md)|The configuration data block is encoded with a NOT XOR 0xFF operation  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Rootkit::Kernel Mode Rootkit (E1014.m17)](../defense-evasion/rootkit.md)|Stuxnet registers custom resource drives signed with a legitimate Realtek digital certificate  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Process Injection::Injection and Persistence via Registry Modification (E1055.m05)](../defense-evasion/process-injection.md)|The driver Stuxnet uses for persistence Mrxcls.sys is registered as a boot start service creating the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MRxCIs\"ImagePath" = "%System%\drivers\mrxcls.sys" [[1]](#1) |
|[Exfiltration::Archive Collected Data::Encoding - Custom Encoding (E1560.m04)](../exfiltration/archive-collected-data.md)|Exfiltrated payloads are XORed with a static 31-byte long byte string found inside Stuxnet and hexified in order to be passed on as an ASCII data parameter in an HTTP request to the C2 servers  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Hide Artifacts (E1564)](../defense-evasion/hide-artifacts.md)|Stuxnet intercepts IRP requests (reads, writes) to devices (NFTS, FAT, CD-ROM). It monitors directory control IRPs, in particular directory query notifications such that when an application requests the list of files, it returns a Stuxnet-specified subset of the true items. These filters hide the files used by Stuxnet to spread through removalbe drives  [[1]](#1) |
|[Execution::Command and Scripting Interpreter (E1059)](../execution/command-and-scripting-interpreter.md)|Stuxnet will store and execute SQL code that will extract and execute Stuxnet from the saved CAB file using xp_cmdshell  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Hijack Execution Flow::Procedure Hooking (F0015.007)](../defense-evasion/hijack-execution-flow.md)|WTR4141.tmp hooks APIs from kernel32.dll and Ntdll.dll and replaces the original code for these functions with code that checks for files with properties pertaining to Stuxnet files. If a request is made to list a file with the specified properties, the response from these APIs is altered to state that the file does not exist, thereby hiding all files with these properties.  [[1]](#1) |
|[Defense Evasion::Obfuscated Files or Information::Encoding-Standard Algorithm (E1027.m02)](../defense-evasion/obfuscated-files-or-information.md)|Encode data using XOR (This capa rule had 3 matches) [[2]](#2) |

## MBC Behaviors

|Name|Use|
|---|---|
|[Impact::Destroy Hardware (B0017)](../impact/destroy-hardware.md)|Stuxnet made the centrifuges at Iran's nuclear plant spin dangerously fast for 15 minutes, before returning to normal speed. About a month later, it slowed the centrifuges down for 50 minutes. This was repeated for several months, and over the strain destroyed the machines [[1]](#1)|
|[Micro-Objective::Process::Create Mutex (C0042)](../micro-behaviors/process/create-mutex.md)|Creates global mutexes signal that rootkit installation has occurred successfully  [[1]](#1)|
|[Micro-Objective::Process::Create Process::Create Process via WMI (C0017.002)](../micro-behaviors/process/create-process.md)|Stuxnet will use WMI operations with the explorere.exe token in order to copy itself and exscute on the remote share  [[1]](#1)|
|[Execution::Conditional Execution::Host Fingerprint Check (B0025.004)](../execution/conditional-execution.md)|Stuxnet checks for specific operating systems on 32-bit machines, registry keys, and dates to profile a potential target machine before execution. If the conditions are not met to be considered a viable target, it will exit execution  [[1]](#1)|
|[Data::Encode Data::XOR (C0026.002)](../micro-behaviors/data/encode-data.md)|Encode data using XOR (This capa rule had 3 matches) [[2]](#2)|
|[Discovery::Code Discovery::Enumerate PE Sections (B0046.001)](../discovery/code-discovery.md)|Enumerate PE sections (This capa rule had 1 match) [[2]](#2)|
|[File System::Delete File (C0047)](../micro-behaviors/file-system/delete-file.md)|Delete file (This capa rule had 1 match) [[2]](#2)|
|[Memory::Allocate Memory (C0007)](../micro-behaviors/memory/allocate-memory.md)|Allocate RWX memory (This capa rule had 1 match) [[2]](#2)|
|[Process::Terminate Process (C0018)](../micro-behaviors/process/terminate-process.md)|Terminate process (This capa rule had 1 match) [[2]](#2)|
