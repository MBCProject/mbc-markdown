Conficker
=========
A worm targeting Microsoft Windows operations systems. 

Enhanced ATT&CK Techniques
---------
|Name|Use|
|---|---|
|[Persistence::Registy Run Keys / Startup folder (F0012)](../persistence/registry-run-keys-startup-folder.md)|To start itself at system boot, the virus saces a copy of its DLL form to a random filename in the Windows system folder, then adds registry keys to have svchost.exe invoke that DLL as an invisible network service  [[1]](#1)|
|[Persistence::Modify Existing Service (F0011)](../persistence/modify-existing-service.md)|Copies itself into the $systemroot%\system32 directory and registers as a service  [[1]](#1)|
|[Defense Evasion::Indicator Blocking (F0006)](../defense-evasion/indicator-blocking.md)|Terminates various services related to system security and Windows and prevents network access to various websites related to antivirus software  [[1]](#1)|
|[Impact::Data Destruction (E1485)](../impact/data-destruction.md)|resets system restore points and deletes backup files [[1]](#1)|
|[Anti-Static Analysis::Software Packing::UPX (F0001.008)](../anti-static-analysis/software-packing.md)|Conficker is propagated as a DLL which has been backed using the UPX packer [[2]](#2)|

MBC Behaviors
---------
|Name|Use|
|---|---|
|[Command and Control::Domain Name Generation (B0031)](../command-and-control/domain-name-generation.md)|Uses a domain name generator seeded by the current date to ensure that every copy of the virus generates the same names on their respective days [[1]](#1)|
|[Execution::Conditional Execution (B0025)](../execution/conditional-execution.md)|Conficker A has routine that causes the process to suicide exit if the keyboard language layout is set to Ukranian  [[1]](#1)|
|[Micro-Behavior::Memory::Overflow Buffer (C0010)](../micro-behaviors/memory/overflow-buffer.md)|Variants A, B, C, and E exploit a vulnerability in the Server Service on Windows computers in which an already compromised computer sends a specially-crafted RPC request to force a buffer overflow and execute shellcode on the target computer  [[1]](#1)|
|[Execution::Conditional Execution::Suicide Exit (B0025.001)](../execution/conditional-execution.md)|Conficker B has significantly more suicide logic embedded in its code and employs anti-debugging features to avoid reverse engineering attempts [[2]](#2)|
