# CAPE Rule Distribution #
February 2023

## Histograms ##
The histograms below show the number of CAPE rules mapped to ATT&CK techniques (organized by tactic), MBC behaviors (organized by objective), and MBC micro-behaviors (organized by micro-objective). The explicit techniques, behaviors, and micro-behaviors follow. 

The data below reflects [community repository signatures](https://github.com/kevoreilly/community/tree/master/modules/signatures) (not including deprecated signatures), as well as [CAPEv2 signatures](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/master/modules/signatures/CAPE.py). 

Information on CAPE signatures can be found [here](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/master/docs/book/src/customization/signatures.rst).
