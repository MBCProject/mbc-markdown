# Micro-behaviors #
Some malware behaviors are low-level, support many objectives and other behaviors, and aren't necessarily malicious. For example, a TCP socket may be created or a string may be checked for some condition. Because such things are often noted in malware analysis, they are captured in MBC. They are called "micro-behaviors."

Like regular MBC behaviors, micro-behaviors are associated with objectives and can have methods that refine them. Micro-objectives are shown below.
