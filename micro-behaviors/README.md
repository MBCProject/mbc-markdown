# Micro-behaviors #
Some malware behaviors are low-level, support many objectives and other behaviors, and aren't necessarily malicious. For example, a TCP socket may be created or a string may be checked for some condition. Because such things are often noted in malware analysis, they are captured in MBC. They are called "micro-behaviors."

Like regular MBC behaviors, micro-behaviors are associated with objectives and can have methods that refine them. Micro-behavior objectives are shown below.

|**Objective**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[**Communication**](./communication)|Malware uses various protocols and components to communication.|
|[**Cryptography**](./cryptography)|Malware uses elements of cryptography.|
|[**Data Manipulation**](./data-manipulation)|Malware manipulates data.|
|[**File Manipulation**](./file-manipulation)|Malware manipulates files.|
|[**Hardware**](./hardware)|Malware has hardware-related behaviors.|
|[**Memory Manipulation**](./memory-manipulation)|Malware manipulates memory.|
|[**Processes**](./processes)|Malware uses processes.|
